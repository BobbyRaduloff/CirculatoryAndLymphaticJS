                    Lymph capillaries extract the lymph from the arterioles and venules.
                    Then the capillaries expand into vessels.There are several nodes that filter the blood as it travels.
                    The duct where the lymph flows back into the circulatory system is called lymph duct and it is located at the meeting point between the right subclavian vein and the right internal jugular vein.
